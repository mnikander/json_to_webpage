# Render buttons from a JSON

Read a JSON file containing pairs (button, action), display those buttons on an HTML page, and execute their corresponding action when the button is clicked.
This serves as practice for some JavaScript and HTML basics.
It is implemented without a framework such as React, Angular, etc.
